# Eclipse_Poland-praktyki_letnie-drugi_etap
String Calculator, a task prepared as part of the recruitment for an internship in eclipse.

Each task was completed with a commit. 
Final corrections and additional comments can be found after the last commit.
The given evaluation task has been solved in a way that allows testing of previous tasks despite changes.
lines // [delimiter]\n as //d1\n (task 4) or //[d1]\n (task 7) or //[d1][d2]\n are still optional,
if we do not add such a line, the delimiter will default to "," or "\ n" (task 3).

Going through the whole task is similar to the logic contained in the TDD, piece by piece tests done due to 
the content of the subsequent tasks (failing tests at the beggining), then added code just enough to pass tests,
then code changed for better without changing existing behaviour ( refactoring, wrining comments etc ).
